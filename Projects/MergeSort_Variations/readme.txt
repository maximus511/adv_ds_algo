Merge sort implementation code for the following flavors, 

a) Allocate dynamic memory in each call to Merge for L and R

b) Use an auxiliary array B[ ] (same size as A).  In each call to Merge, copy contents from A to B and then merge them back to A, in sorted order. 

c) Use an auxiliary array B[ ] (same size as A).  When data is in A[p..q..r], it is merged into B[p..r]. When data is in B[p..q..r], it is merged into A[p..r]

Implementation of regular quick sort.
