The dictionary ADT is defined on a set of (key,value) pairs, where the
   keys are totally ordered.  The following operations are defined:

   a. Insert(k,v): insert a new entry with key k, value v.  If a key with
                   key k already exists, its value is replaced by v.

   b. Find(k): return the value associated with key k.  If there is
               no element with key k, it returns null (or 0).

   c. FindMin(): return (k,v) corresponding to the current smallest key

   d. FindMax(): return (k,v) corresponding to the current largest key

   e. Remove(k): remove element with key k.  Returns value of deleted
                 element (null or 0 if such a key does not exist).

   f. RemoveValue(v): remove all elements whose value is v.  Returns
                      number of elements deleted.

   g. Size(): return the number of elements currently stored.

   h. IsEmpty(): boolean indicating whether the current store is empty.

Implement the ADT using (a) Skip lists, (b) Splay trees,
(c) AVL or Red-Black trees and any other data structure that you think
is best suited for the problem, and compare their performances empirically,
by comparing their running times over a large number of operations.


NOTE: 
* For each implementation X the "XOperations.java" file is the main class for executing the program.

* The input is taken from an input file- “input.txt”, and the output will be displayed on the console.

* Some part of the code has been referred from the internet.
